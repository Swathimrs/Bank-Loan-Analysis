# Bank-Loan-Analysis
This repository contains a Tableau project that provides a comprehensive analysis of Nexus bank loan data. The dashboard offers insights into loan applications, funded amounts, received amounts, interest rates, and debt-to-income (DTI) ratios, broken down by various dimensions such as purpose, grade, employee length, and home ownership.

**Project Overview**
This Tableau project aims to visualize key metrics related to bank loans, allowing for quick identification of trends, performance, and potential areas of concern. It provides a holistic view of the loan portfolio, from application to repayment status.

**Key Features**

**Interactive Dashboards:** Explore data dynamically with filters for Purpose, Grade, and Verification Status.

**Performance Tracking:** Monitor Month-to-Date (MTD) and Month-over-Month (MoM) changes for key metrics.

**Loan Status Analysis:** Gain insights into "Good Loan" vs. "Bad Loan" performance.

**Geographical Insights:** Visualize loan distribution by state.

**Detailed Loan Information:** Drill down into individual loan records.

**Dashboard Sections**

The project is structured into three main dashboards:

**A. Summary**
The Summary dashboard provides a high-level overview of the loan portfolio's health.

**1.Key Metrics:** Displays total loan applications (38.6K), total funded amount ($435.8M), total amount received ($473.1M), average interest rate (12.0%), and average DTI (13.3%). MTD and MoM changes are also highlighted.

**2.Good vs. Bad Loans:** Visualizes the proportion of good (86.2%) and bad (13.8%) loans issued, along with their respective application counts, funded amounts, and received amounts.

**3.Loan Status Breakdown:** Shows the number of applications, total amount received, total funded amount, MTD funded amount, average interest rate, and average DTI for different loan statuses (Charged Off, Current, Fully Paid).

**B. Overview**
The Overview dashboard presents a more detailed breakdown of loan performance across various dimensions.

**Key Metrics:** Similar to the Summary, it displays the overall key metrics (Total Loan Applications, Total Funded Amount, Total Amount Received, Average Interest Rate, Avg DTI) with MTD and MoM comparisons.

**Amount Received by Month:** A line chart showing the trend of total amount received over the months.

**Amount Received by State:** A map visualization indicating the total amount received from different states.

**Amount Received by Term:** A donut chart showing the distribution of total amount received by loan terms (e.g., 36 months, 60 months).

**Amount Received by Employee Length:** A bar chart illustrating the total amount received based on the employee's length of service.

**Total Amount Received by Purpose:** A bar chart detailing the total amount received for various loan purposes (e.g., Debt Consolidation, Home Improvement, Credit Card).

**Total Amount Received by Home Ownership:** A breakdown of the total amount received based on the borrower's home ownership status (Mortgage, Rent).

**C. Details**

The Details dashboard allows for a granular view of individual loan records.

**Key Metrics:** Displays the overall key metrics (Total Loan Applications, Total Funded Amount, Total Amount Received, Average Interest Rate, Avg DTI) with MTD and MoM comparisons.

**Loan Data Table:** A detailed table listing individual loan records with columns such as ID, Purpose, Home Ownership, Grade, Sub Grade, Issue Date, Installment, Loan Amount, Total Payment, and Interest Rate.
